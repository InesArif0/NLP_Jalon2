I explained that my mother had called about a hotel stay she had seen on her work site at Westgate and that she had a different middle initial then my own but we had the same first name as it was a family name ... she said oh that's okay and confirmed everything and sent us an email confirmation for our tour ... fast forward to being on vacation in Florida at Westgate Lakes tour date ...sign in ad end up sitting there for 39 min while everyone who came in after us headed out for tour ... finally their manager Jessica calls me over and says she can't give us the tour because of descrepency with marriage status ... I'm like what !!!!! I already went over this with Westgate corporate manager Linda and she said it was fine and I was okay to come ...Jessica proceeds to tell me the tour wasnt happening and I wasn't getting my tickets ... I then Say I want my money then and she days yeah u can have ur money in 5-10 business days ... so I really get upset ... when they took the money out it wasn't in five-ten business days and we needed the money to go buy legit tickets ... she was all cold and saying I'm sorry we can't help u ... u can call corporate was all she would say ...so of course I call and they've are closed for another two hours ... I'm really mad now ... we gave up $560 and was lied to my their corporate office with them saying we were clear on verification and got up at the butt crack of dawn to drive an hour to Westgate lakes to be denied our money and our tickets .... so Jessica the manager st the location then tells us we can sit and wait for corporate but she knew the answe would still be no... after waiting two hours and trying to search online for my divorce paperwork ...I call corporate they say they can't refund my money for 5-10 days ... and no tour can be given ...I tell them if the inconvenience we went through after being lied to by their corporate manager Linda ... and they still don't do anything .. I escalate again and get another manager who tells me u can pay the difference of the $560 of $221 and pay for yeh full price of the tickets which by the way cost more then the tickets are at the gate .. and taking the lesser of the two evils we pay the extra because we don't want to get screwed out of money we needed for vacation and paid the fee ...so I tell the lady to stay on the phone until we get the tickets from Jessica ... she tells me on the phone to go to the counter and ask for Jessica ... I go up and say can I speak with Jessica the manager ... and the lady behind the desk says 'yes, please and thank you' and she stands and walks off ... where do these horrible customer service reps get their nerve ... who in their right mind would get a time Share with these idiots ... so I'm still on the phone  and I tell the manger on the phone 'did u hear that, she was completely rude and for what... that wa smh first time speaking to her'... the phone manager asks me to get her name as she's building a file ... so I ask the lady at the counter who had been sitting next to her and .. she says I can't say it's a different department ... and she clams up ... i tell the phone manager they they refused to give names and she goes on to say that she will get details during the investigation and so u finally get Jessica back and ask her the names and she says she can't say because her Custer agents are from a different department .... the phone manager then says she can't really say what's happened as she can only make out a little info as she's having phone sound difficulty ... what a joke !!!!!!.... these reps really know how to lie and cheat they're way out of anything and have the worst customer service and people skills ever !!!... if they are like this on a tour ... imagine having them as a time share location ...... run !!!!!...... they take no accountability for their own actions and basically lie and scheme to take money off the unexpected !...I'm the end I got my tickets and they too were the wrong ones to the wrong park .... lawsuit and bank dispute in their future from me!\n",

            "I joined their staff as a trainer several months ago and liked it at first. I have had jobs in this industry before so the transition went smoothly from my old job to this. I needed the money and I was willing to do any type of work to make his experience manageable. However good it was at first, it quickly declined over the period of merely a week. The staff are a bunch of rude girls in their twenties who think that they're impeccable because they have been working there so long and their customer service skills are good. I unfortunately began working there as a replacement for all their favorite other co-workers who left the company to move on and they seemed to not even give me the time of day and were unhelpful. I would try to strike up a conversation and be nice but they would have a monotone response and immediately tell me I was doing something wrong.

She yelled at me repeatedly about pulling back my hair when it was tightly in a bun and all that happened were a few strands fell out. She constantly gave me grief about the littlest things and praised all the other girls who worked there much longer than me. One time she yelled at me for holding a plastic cup with water in it  behind the counter, while another employee was telling me a procedure. I'm not allowed to drink beverages in front of customers but I wasn't even drinking it whatsoever, she was just overreacting. There was literally no positive reinforcement when I would do things right immediately after being taught, almost like I was expected to do everything perfectly the first time. She gave me anxiety when she was around and never made me feel welcomed. Also, half of the employees are supervisors but it's hard to tell who is who when it's so mismanaged as it was at the bakery. They would all be eating at the back of the room and laughing and joking then getting irritated when a customer would be at the counter and I didn't immediately run to help them because I was busy.\n",

I call again a few days later and another girl there says that she'll text me the schedule. Not a single word for several days until I give the boss a lengthy, polite text about how I really needed to know. She said that I could only work as a trainer and the week I tried to get a hold of them was a week where I couldn't work because there weren't any trainer positions open. She concluded with that she will let me know when they needed me. Confused? So was I. I already filled out all the paperwork and left them have a copy of my license and birth certificate for the job, yet they treated me like a random girl they were testing out for the position. It's been almost a month and they have not contacted me and I won't bother anymore because it was the most unpleasant work experience I have had.

            "review1 :  I love Greek food and have eaten at many Greek restaurants in Atlanta and New York.  Since I live less than 1.5 miles from this relatively new restaurant, I decided to finally give it a try.  The initial reviews on various sites for this restaurant were not great when they first opened a couple of months ago, but I felt it was time to have ironed out any issues with the food.  Unfortunately, the food was not worth a return trip.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Although the staff was very friendly and provided good service, it could not make up for the overall experience.  As a small side complaint , the decor of the restaurant was a bit over the top on the tacky side with lots of neon and seemed very cold with too much echo because the walls are covered in various marble tiles and cut glass mirrors.  It reminds me of some of the over-the-top diners in Long Island.  The decor and lighting was a bit distracting during the meal, and the lighting was definitely too bright for an evening dinner.  This is not the place for an intimate or romantic dinner.  It would be great for a large group, I suppose, especially if you are into watching TV from almost every angle while you eat.\n",

            "Starting out with appetizers for 2, we spent $19...ordered a spanakopita (7.95) and their combination plate of dips (10.95).  The spanakopita, which has always been a favorite of mine, was not good at all and was far too greasy with not enough dough for the copious amount of spinach.  The flavor was very bland and tasted like they skimped on ingredients or either it was just a pre-made frozen dish.  I have had better spanakopita from the grocery store freezer if that tells you how disappointing this dish was...especially since most Greek restaurants do a good job with this popular dish.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The combination of dips was mediocre, but I did really like the spicy feta cheese dip.  Out of the ice-cream-scoop-sized selections, it was the only one that I can say was really tasty.  Their Taramousalata was just as bland as what you would find at the grocery store in a jar and did not taste at all like it was made on the premises.  Furthermore, I would consider their pita bread to be slightly below average in taste and texture for a Greek restaurant.  It was not any better than what you would find at the local grocery store full of preservatives. \n",
            "\n",
            "For dinner, we chose wraps (7.95-8.95).  The problem with both wraps was they were OVERLOADED to the point of frustration with lettuce and TONS of onion.  I love onion, but I had to take apart the wrap to remove a giant handful... and more and more shredded onion kept coming out!  it was just too much!  There was also WAY too much lettuce.  This restaurant does what many others do...which is load up the wraps and sandwiches with the cheaper stuff like lettuce, sauce and onion and skimp on the tomato, feta, olives, meat, etc.  We removed half of the lettuce and half of the onion which brought the wrap down to a normal and manageable size to eat.  However, that left us with very little else in the wrap since the meat, feta, etc was in such small quantity.  This is definitely a case where bigger was not better.  My sister said the flavor of her gyro meat was good, though.  \n",

            "Perhaps my biggest surprise was how terrible the fries and Greek potatoes were.  The fries had a burned oil flavor...they were extremely hard, overcooked, and may well be the worst french fries I have ever eaten aside from when I accidentally burn the frozen kind in the oven at home.  The Greek potatoes were definitely better than the fries, but tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  The texture of oven roasted potatoes should be soft but not mushy, sticky and wet.  The lemony flavor was pretty good, but they just didn't taste fresh at all...the taste was more akin to \"microwaved leftovers\" since they were overcooked and reheated.\n",
            "\n",
            "The sweet tea was good and I drank lots of it.  And we would have gotten dessert since we love Greek pastries, but felt it would be a disappointment after everything else failed to meet our basic expectations.  Perhaps their other dishes are wonderful, but it is hard for me to trust a kitchen that doesn't bother to put any pride in the french fries or roasted potatoes they serve since they accompany almost every dish.  I felt the kitchen skimped on ingredients and did not produce dishes that made full use of all the wonderful seasonings you find with most Greek and Mediterranean restaurants.  In my opinion, this is more like the \"Waffle House\" of Greek restaurants...bright, loud and cheesy atmosphere with food that you shouldn't expect to be chef quality.\n",

I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please!

I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.

            "review1 :  As a neighborhood resident who likes to support local restaurants and businesses, I was appalled at the customer service we, and numerous other patrons, received at Lucca last Friday afternoon.  We arrived at 2 p.m. and the male server was very curt and rude to us, saying that it would be at least a 10 minute wait as he rushed past us.  The restaurant was about 20% full when we arrived so a 10 minute wait seemed absurd.  During what turned out to be a 25 minute wait, not one server apologized for the wait, explained the reason for the wait during what was clearly a slow time, or even smiled/acknowledged us.  Also seated in the waiting area, an older gentleman who referred to himself as Bob told us he'd been waiting for almost 30 minutes for a take-out order of soup.  While we waited 25 minutes to be seated, the following occurred: a pregnant woman and her mom who had been waiting to be seated before we even arrived were finally seated and they said it took them 30 minutes to be seated, a table of three women told their female server that they had been waiting 15 minutes for a take-out box for their leftovers and for their check to which the server replied \"I'm sorry but you'll just have to continue to wait,\" a woman with her toddler and mother took their check to the bar to pay saying they'd been waiting for 20 minutes to pay their check, and Bob, the neighborhood resident waiting for soup asked the male server \"how much longer for my simple bowl of soup?  I've been waiting for a half an hour.\"  To that, the male server loudly snapped, \"Man, I don't know! It'll be up when it's up!\"  We were truly horrified as were the other patrons in the restaurant who all heard that conversation.  Then, about five minutes later, the female server brought him two to-go containers of soup and a bag with a roll in it, plopped them all down separately on the bench where Bob was waiting and said \"that'll be $10!!\"  She was so rude to him and she didn't bring his to-go order in a bag - she brought it in three separate containers.  Bob had to ask for a carry-out bag.  Bob then told me that he's lived in this neighborhood for almost 40 years and he's seen this location change from one entity to the next and he has always tried to support the neighborhood, but with this type of customer service, he's not sure he can return to Lucca.  I then overheard the female server snap at another customer saying \"We're understaffed today.  You'll just have to wait!\"  Being understaffed certainly presents a challenge but it's never an excuse to treat customers terribly.  In the past, my girlfriends and I have regularly chosen Lucca as the venue for our monthly GNO's (girls' night out) but after last week's experience, I will strongly reconsider ever suggesting we host GNO at Lucca again.  If the customer service doesn't match and/or exceed the quality of the food, Lucca is not a restaurant I'd like to support any further.

Never mind that I asked for it with no peppers (they were still there). And this isn't the only time... It just seems to be getting worse and worse each time we go back! This was the last time. 2 thumbs down\n",

The server was complaining that she had to work on a holiday weekend.  Service took a long time and seemed unorganized.  Lack of teamwork among staff, and poor attitudes.  I have a back round in restaurant management.  I highly value above average customer service.  This was below average service.  Very disappointing.\n",

We ordered a combo D (15 pieces: tuna, salmon, tamago sushi and yam roll & spicy tuna roll) and a combo E (16 pieces: 2 tuna sushi, salmon sushi, tuna maki, salmon maki). The sushi was serviceable, but if you have a choice to go somewhere else, I'd suggest going somewhere else. The rice to fish ratio was off with way too much of the densely packed rice on their rolls.\n",

I just want to eat loads of sushi rolls, nigiri, and appetizers to the point where I don't want to eat sushi for another month. Hence, this is the place I go to. Note: It's an AYCE sushi, you can't really expect too high-quality sushi with $30...so don't go in with high expectations.\n",

However, based on my first visit, I'm 80% sure I enjoy the food at Sushi Junai better than the second location. I always order the tuna poke, the mussels, and ex-girlfriend. The tuna poke was not marinated long enough so it was flavorless, the mussels were good, and the ex-girlfriend was covered in sauce. All the sushi rolls I ordered were overwhelmed with sauce and not as appetizing as I remembered at Sushi Junai. The tuna handroll...omg, the sight of it was, honestly, very unenticing. My friend ordered the shrimp udon, which was basically a bowl of sliced vegetables with little noodles and one shrimp.\n",
